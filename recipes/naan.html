    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>
    A leavened flat bread originating from northern India, which is traditionally baked by slapping the bread dough onto the
    side of a hot dome shaped clay oven referred to as a tandoor. <br>
    The dough's weight would normally cause it to fall into a teardrop shape, which is the recognizable characteristic of naan bread.<br>
    However, with changes in baking processes there are now a variety of shapes from round to oval that are readily produced.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li> 2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoons of sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon instant dry yeast/rapid-rise yeast </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
       
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>
            <p>
                In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy. Stir in sugar, milk, egg, salt,
                and enough flour to make a soft dough.<br> 
                Knead for 6 to 8 minutes on a lightly floured surface, or until smooth.<br>
                Place dough in a well oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and set aside to rise. Let it rise 1 hour, until the dough has
                doubled in volume.

            <p>
            Punch down dough, and knead in garlic. <br>
            Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball.<br> 
            Roll into balls, and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.

                During the second rising, preheat grill to high heat.

            <p>
                At grill side, roll one ball of dough out into a thin circle. Lightly oil grill. <br>
                Place dough on grill, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until puffy and lightly browned. <br>
                Brush uncooked side with butter, and turn over. Brush cooked side with butter, and cook until browned, another 2 to 4 minutes. <br>
                Remove from grill, and continue the process until all the naan has been prepared.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
            Cut each chicken breast into small chunks (roughly 2.5cm) and season generously with freshly ground black pepper.<br>
            Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large nonstick frying pan or wok and fry the chicken over a medium-high heat for 5-6 mins, turning
            occasionally. <br>
            Transfer the chicken to a plate using a slotted spoon or spatula and return the pan to the heat. Keep the
            chicken warm by covering in foil or placing in the oven on a low heat.

        </li>
        </p>


        <li>
            <p>
            Add the remaining oil, butter and onions to the pan and cook over a medium heat, stirring often, for 10 mins, or until
            the onions are soft and lightly browned.<br>
            Stir in the ginger and garlic paste and ground spices and cook, stirring
            continuously, for a further 1 min.



        </li>
        </p>

        <li>
            <p>
            Add the mango chutney and stock to the spiced onions and bring to a simmer.<br>
            Cook for 5 mins or until the liquid has reduced by roughly half, stirring regularly. <br>
            (For an extra smooth sauce, blitz the mixture with a blender.)



        </li>
        </p>

        <li>
            <p>
            Return the chicken to the pan with the onions, add the cream and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 5-6 mins, <br>
            until the chicken is piping hot and cooked through. Add a splash of water to loosen the sauce if necessary.



        </li>
        </p>
       


        <li>
            <p>
                    Garnish the curry with toasted flaked almonds and scatter with fresh coriander, if you like. Serve with freshly cooked
                    rice.

        <li>2 tablespoon ghee</li>
        <li>1 handful raw peanuts</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> <p>
        <strong>Saut√© cumin seeds for potato filling</strong><br>
        To make delicious samosas at home, first, make the filling.<br> 
        Put a pan on medium flame and add 2 tsp oil in it. Once the
        oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds and allow them to crackle.
      </li></p>
    

      <li><p>
        <strong> spices and boiled potatoes and cook for a while<br></strong>
        Now, add whole coriander seeds, ginger and green chilli.<br> 
        Saute for a minute and then add chopped cashews and raisins,
        peanuts if you like them, boiled and mashed potatoes, cumin powder,<br>
         coriander powder, garam masala powder, red chilli
        powder, salt to taste, kasoori methi leaves, coriander leaves. Mix well and saute for 2 minutes. Your stuffing is ready!


      </li></p>

    <li><p>

        <strong> the dough for the Samosa</strong><br>
        Now, to prepare the dough, take a mixing bowl and combine all-purpose flour along with carom seeds and salt.<br>
         Mix and then add ghee and start kneading by adding a little water at a time.<br>
          Ensure that you add water gradually and make a firm dough. A soft dough will not make your samosas crispy.<br>
          Cover the dough with a damp muslin cloth and keep aside for about half an hour.

    </li></p>

    <li><p>

        <strong>Roll the dough in small puris and cut into half</strong><br>
        Once done, roll out few small-sized balls from the dough.<br>
         Flatten them further with the help of your palms and then with
        a rolling pin. <br>
        Give them a round shape and cut in half. Now dip your hands in water, fold the edges of the semi-circle
        in order to give it a cone shape.

    </li></p>


    <li><p>
        <strong>Fill the semi-circle with potato filling and deep fry</strong> <br>
        Take the filling with the help of a spoon and stuff it in the cone. <br>
        Seal the ends properly by pressing the edges lightly with your fingers. <br>
        Then, heat oil in a pan and deep fry the samosas on low heat until they turn golden brown and crispy. <br>
        Serve with tomato ketchup and green chutney. Enjoy it as a tea-time snack!
